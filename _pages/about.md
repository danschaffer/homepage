Hi, my name is Dan Schaffer. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer in the Boston area.  I focus on Amazon Web Services and Kubernetes.  My interested are in
automating infrastructure and continuous integration and continuous delivery
systems.  

I enjoy cooking, tinkering with electronics, and 3d printing.  I do a lots
of baking with sourdough and like the try new recipes.  I like to play around
and program small microcontrollers with sensors.  I built a small 3d printer
and like to keep improving it.  Overall I like to learn and experiment with
new projects.

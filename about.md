Hi, I am a software engineering and site reliabilty engineer in the Boston area.  My work interests are automating processes and creating infrastructure mostly on AWS.  I enjoy learning new technologies and tackling difficult problems.  

My other interests are 3d printing, electronics, rock climbing, biking and running!  I also really like cooking, looking at pictures of food, and tacking random cooking projects.

My home page is meant to document my random notes and projects.  I wrote the site using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the site hosted on aws using s3, route53, and cloudfront.  Further posts may describe the process of building the home page.

You can find the source code for my site here:

Kimba is a pretty good cat.  We adopted Kimba about 5 years ago and
despite her occasional issues she keeps us entertained as well as
keeping our feet warm.  I have almost no scratches from Kimba as opposed to bad experiences with previous cats.  We get along well since she prefers bitter IPAs with fancy labels and cans are cooler than bottles these days.  Kimba enjoys the aroma but actually does not drink or lick.  No beer was consumed during the making of this photograph.

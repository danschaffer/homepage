I want to try this recipe from Claire Saffitz on making ice cream sandwiches.  I like the idea of making two thin brownies and slicing each into sandwiches.  There was a cool trick to slice the ice cream carton with a knife to get chunks of ice cream.  By using vanilla ice cream and mixing in things you can customize to your favorites.  I like the idea of crushed oreos but may try some other things.  The key seems to be freezing each layer then making sure its frozen solid when slicing.

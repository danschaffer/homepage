Garlic confit is just garlic cooked slowly in olive oil.  I was making hummus and adding olive oil and garlic.  The confit, like roasted garlic will not have the bitterness of raw garlic.  Adding some rosemary or other herbs infuses additonal flavor.  The garlic confit can be kept in the fridge in an airtight jar submerged 
in oil.  Choose a small oven safe crock or small pot since you want to place the cloves in a single layer then submerge with olive oil.  The oil and garic are great
on pasta, gnocchi, hummus, or plain on bread.

### Ingredients
#### 
- 1 head garlic
- extra virgin olive oil to cover the garlic cloves
- 1 bit of salt
- few sprigs of rosemary or similar herb

### Steps
- preheat oven to 290F
- peel all garlic cloves
- add to a small oven safe crock dish, should be able to fill a single layer of garic cloves
- add olive oil to submerge cloves
- add rosemary and a few pinches of salt
- roast in oven for 1h to 1h 15m, until cloves are soft
- cool to room temp, add to a jar and keep in fridge for 2-3 weeks

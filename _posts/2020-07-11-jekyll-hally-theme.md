Today I switched to a new Jekyll theme named [Hally](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hally-masonry-jekyll-theme) by [Artem Sheludko](https://jekyllthemes.io/developers/artem-sheludko).  I previously used the free alembic template but after a few attempts I could never get features like search
working well.  I paid $29 for the template and so far think it was well worth
the price to get an easy to use and well designed template.  Hopefully the new
look can motivate me to post more frequently.

The pumpkin and prailine pie is one of my favorite pies but there are lots of steps and it can be fussy.  The filling is really a mousse so it comes out light and opposed to a standard heavy pumpkin pie.

The prailine are almonds cooked in confectioners sugar.  It is somewhat dangerous to make the prailines since the melted sugar is super hot so be careful not to touch the pan.  Also I have ruined pans from the sugar sticking too much or taking off the coating.  Make sure to use a wooden spoon.  You can soak the pan and wooden spoon to melt the hardened sugar.  I make the prailine a few days ahead and grind into a powder when making the cookie crust.  You can make the crust and the filling a day ahead.  Whipping the egg white and cream is best done the day of serving.  Make sure to grind the prailines well and avoid large pieces since they are hard to chew.

I like to put one layer of the mousse in the crust then add a layer of prailine then add more mousse.  You can finish the pie right before serving by adding more prailine and some chocolate shavings.  Make sure the refrigerate the mousse to keep it thick.

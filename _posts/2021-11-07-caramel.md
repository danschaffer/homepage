Making caramels from scratch is not too difficult and you can control all of flavors.  The melted sugar is really hot
so be very careful around the caramel to avoid burns.  I like the vanilla and salt flavors but would like to try the
fall seasonings Sohla recommends.  Seems straight forward to slice in squares but making a thinner caramel and rolling
is another good option.  The caramels can last a while if you can avoid eating them.

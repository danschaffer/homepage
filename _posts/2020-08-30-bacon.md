I liked watching the youtube video below from food52 on bacon.  I used to mostly fry bacon in skillet or cast iron.  Sometimes I would bake on a wire rack.  After
watching to video now I usually bake in the oven on parchment paper at 325 degrees.

### Ingredients
- good bacon, as many as strips fit on cookie sheet or can use 2 cookie sheets

### Steps
- preheat oven to 325 F
- place bacon strips on parchment paper on cookie sheets
- bake until look dark and crispy about 20 minutes
- can place on a plate on paper towels to absorb the fast and letting them cool the bacon will get nice and crispy

Spiced pecans are a family tradition around the holidays.  I like the heavy flavors from the bitters, bourbon, and hot spices.  The nuts
last for a while.  It is nice to make these the week before Christmas and enjoy them through New Years.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb whole pecans
- 1/2 cup bourbon
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp bitters
- 1 T worcestershire sauce
- 1 T oil
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper

### Steps
- preheat oven to 350
- blanch pecans in boiling water 1-2 minutes

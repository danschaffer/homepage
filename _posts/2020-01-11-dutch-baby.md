A Dutch Baby is a puffy omelette baked in the oven in a skillet.  The dutch baby is also known as tahitian omelette or german pancake. We enjoy the dutch baby for dinner sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped
with fruit preserves.  When out of the oven the pancake is very puffy
but quickly deflates so try to serve immediately after taking out of the oven.

A cast iron skillet is very good at retaining the heat evenly and the preheating of the skillet is a good way of seasoning the skillet.  The skillet gets very hot so best to move the pancake to a cutting board
when serving.  The longest step in making the dutch baby is preheating the oven and heating up the cast iron skillet.  While the oven is preheating probably is quicker to also put the skillet in the oven.  To help season the skillet rub with oil and place in oven while preheating.

The recipe is from the New York time online. Here is a nice video with lovely music.

I like this youtube video on food52 for Barley Oat Biscuits.  I like the idea of a salty and sweet easy to make cracker.  You can keep some in the 
uncooked crackers in the freezer and bake them off when you would like some fresh crackers.  I like how you can mostly throw the ingredients in
a food processor to bring together the dough.  Samantha suggests having the biscuits with manhattans.

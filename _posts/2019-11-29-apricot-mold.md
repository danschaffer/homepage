The apricot mold is another thanksgiving favorite.  The sour cream gives it a creaminess and the peaches or apricots gives it a fruity.  It's a nice combination with with the turkey and stuffing.  You will need a special mold and it is a bit difficult to successfully unmold.  When you are confident it is solid you can run a knife around the edge of the mold and soak the mold in warm water for like 15 seconds.  

I found apricot jello on amazon.  You can always use peach.  Also I can never find apricot nectar so I use mango nectar.  I also use canned peaches since can never find canned apricots.  Be sure to drain the canned fruit since the the mold won't solidify with the extra liquid.  When starting the recipe make sure you fully dissolve both the plain gelatin and the apricot jello.      

### Ingredients
- 1/2 envelope of plain gelatin
- 1 3 oz packet of apricot jello (can use peach)
- 2 cups mango nectar (I can never find apricot)
- 1 can sliced peaches drained of liquid (I can never find apricot)
- 3/4 cup sour cream

- cuisinart to chop the canned peaches

### Steps
- in a small saucepan stir unflavored gelatin in 2-3T of the nectar
- heat on low stirring constantly until jello is dissolved
- in a bigger pot heat 1 cup nectar with the jello, add plain gelatin from above
- still constantly for 5m until the jello is fully dissolved
- let cool in fridge until is semi-solid (for about 30-60m)
- puree the canned peaches with the remaining nectar
- beat into the chilled jello mixture
- add sour cream mix until smooth
- pour into oiled mold
- refrigerate until solid,  I usually cool overnight
- before ready to serve, run knife around edges of mold
- carefully dip mold in warm water to loosen

Flour sourdough torillas are a great use for sourdough discard.  The sourdough adds a subtle taste and provides a small amount of leavening avoiding the need for adding baking powder or soda.  Homemade torillas taste so good when freeze and last pretty well for a day or two.  Extra tortillas can also be frozen.  I like making the tortillas in the morning for breakfast burritos and extra tortillas can be used for lunch quesadillas.  Extras can also be cut into tortilla chips.  

When making the dough they the balls can be rested for 30m to make easier to roll but works with a few minutes rest.  Use liberal amounts of flour to keep from sticking.  I used a hot cast iron pan to fry the tortillas.  They absorb oil so in between
each tortilla I add a bit of oil and spread to make a thin coating.

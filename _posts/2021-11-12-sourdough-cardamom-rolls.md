The cardamom rolls are a sweet enriched dough with eggs and butter.  The recipe uses a yudane where boiling water is mixed with flour for an hour to create a softer dough.  The rolls are similar to cinnamon rolls but not quite a sweet.  I used fresh caradmom pods and ground them in an old coffee grinder.

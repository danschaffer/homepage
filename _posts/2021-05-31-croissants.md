Croissants seem like a really big challenge. The most difficult part seems like forming the butter into a dough like layer and folding into the rolled out dough. Performing the folds to get all the layers of dough and butter laminated seems difficult.  Sounds like hitting the dough with a rolling pin to help flatten out the dough helps to get even layers.  I froze the croissants after forming and they came out nicely a week later.  I may try to bake 4 immediately and freeze the other four next time.  The process was time consuming but the croissants tasted great and were very flakey and buttery.  I used a European butter hearing they roll out easier.

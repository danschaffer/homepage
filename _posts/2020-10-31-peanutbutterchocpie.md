Found this recipe on food52 as a quick meringue custard pie recipe using sweetened condensed milk.  The pie filling can be lemon juice and lemon zest or substiting 3/4 cup of peanut butter or combination of chocolate and peanut butter. Sweetened condensed milk
really make the recipe much easier and accounts for all of the sugar.  With the egg white I make a meringue topping and using a torch adds a caramel flavor and looks nice.  I use my standard single crust recipe with half butter and half shortening.  The pie shell is then blind baked.  I have some pie weight but can use dried beans or anything similar just to give a little weight and help the pie crust keep it's shape.

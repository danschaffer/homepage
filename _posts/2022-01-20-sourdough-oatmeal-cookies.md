Looking for a recipe to use sourdough discord to make cookies I found this recipe online.  Seems like a standard oatmeal recipe substituting sourdough for flour and liquid.  I will make these often when I want to feed the starter from the fridge.  I often make crackers with the discard but here is another option.  I would not use sourdough in other cookies like sugar cookies or chocolate chip since would take away from the pure butter and vanilla flavor.  But I like how the sourdough flavor adds to the spices and works in these cookies.  I think would also work with a peanut butter or other nut butter cookie.

#### Ingredients
- 1c butter (2 sticks)
- 1c brown sugar
- 1/2c granulated sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1/2c (120g) starter

- 2c (170g) old fashioned oats
- 2c (280g) all purpose flour
- 1t baking soda
- 1t salt
- 1t cinnamon
- 1/2t nutmeg

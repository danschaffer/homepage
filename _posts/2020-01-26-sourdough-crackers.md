Crackers are a really nice and easy way to use discarded sourdough
starter.  There is enough liquid in the starter so you only need
to add flour, butter, and salt to make the cracker dough.

The recipe is from the King Arthur web site.  I try to always use
King Arthur flour and they have very good sourdough recipes on their
web site.

You can instead of the starter use 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water
to make crackers from scratch.  They are really delicious especially
when fresh on the first day and when warm.  You can keep them plain or add any kind of dried herb.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup (240g) unfed sourdough from fridge
- 1 cup (140g) flour (any kind, unbleached or whole wheat are good)
- 1 t salt
- 4 T butter (melted)
- 1-2 T dried herbs, rosemary
- oil for brushing
- sea salt

### Steps
- mix sourdough, flour, salt, butter, herbs in a mixer or by hand until dough becomes cohesive
- put in bowl and refrigerate at least 30m

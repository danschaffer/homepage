The strawberry and rhubarb muffins recipe is from the first Flour cookbook.  Is a nice recipe always comes out well. The muffins are
not too sweet.  You can always add additional sugar on top if you prefer sweeter.  I find it easier to use paper muffin/cupcake liner then
you do not have to worry about sticking and is easier to pop out.  Be careful to loosen to muffin tops before removing muffins.  I find it
not too difficult to prepare in morning but you can make the dough the night before then just preheat the oven and add dough to tins in the morning.
We happened to have lots of extra rhubarb after making pie.  The recipe also suggests for different flavors instead of rhubarb and raspberry can also use 2 cups blueberries or 400g peaches about 4 with ginger,

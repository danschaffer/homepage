After having fresh pretzels with pimento cheese dip at Winter Hill Brewery I wanted to find a recipe.  I thought it would be great to serve with chips or store bought pretzels.  I found a New York Time recipe looking pretty easy to make.  It is mostly cream cheese, cheddar cheese, with jarred pimentos peppers or other spicy red peppers.  The dip is also tasty with ritz crackers or topping in a sandwich with turkey.

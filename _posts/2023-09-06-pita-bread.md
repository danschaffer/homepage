Found a recipe for making pita bread.  The recipe is a basic sourdough roll.  I used a pizza oven at about 500-600F and I would try with a regular oven at 500F with a baking stone. After making the dough and allowing to rise I created 8 dough balls about 100g each.  I let the dough ball rise a bit then right before baking each one I rolled the dough ball into a flat disc. In the pizza oven I just bake for about 30s then when started to puff up rotated the pita around then flipped to cook on other side.  Some pitas really puffed out a lot. Leaving the pita for about an hour covered with a towel they soften up. I used a little yeast
but the sourdough is active probably do not need the bit of yeast.  I added lots of extra flour from the original recipe to avoid
a stick dough.

I have enjoyed reading the new cookbook Book on Pie by Erin McDowell and watching the food52 videos on her baking series. We prefer
fruit pies but in the winter fruit is not as good or plentiful.  I find custard pies often too sweet so the swamp pie seems like
a good compromise of having blueberries and lemons with vanilla and cream.  The streusel topping seems to add good crunch and textural
constrast.  The recipe is a little more involved since the crust is parbaked and there are two separate fillings.  I usually make
the crust the night before and keeping in the fridge makes the crust easier to roll out.  I still prefer a crust with butter and
shortening to get nice flakiness.  I would probably rate the recipe as being an advanced pie recipe with all of the steps and having
to pour the custard into the dish after most of the baking.  I chose to use a high sided pie dish to hold the extra liquid.

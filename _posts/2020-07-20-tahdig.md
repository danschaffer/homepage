I have been reading Samin Nosrat's Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat and really liked her Netflix show with the same name.  Also I have been watching lots of Food52 youtube videos.  There is a great episode showing the recipe including chatting in Samin.  Tahdig is a persian crispy rice with great salty, creamy flavor.  I really like preparing with fried egg over each serving. The rice comes together pretty quickly so it's a great weeknight meal.  The leftovers also are great for a few days.  I usually use a 10 or 12 inch non stick.  Watching the video helps some of the details.

I was looking for a good recipe for sourdough discard bluerry scones.  I think the sourdough would add some flavor and give a nice rise making the scones bread like.  I like the combination of blueberries and lemons.  Since baking frozen blueberries are easy to find and can be done year round.  In the summer can try to use fresh to see if there is a difference.  They were puffy from the sourdough.  I found the glaze to not be necessary and maybe some thick sugar like demerra or pearl would add like crunch and sweetness on the top. Glazing half would work out well.  I would like to try other fillings besides blueberries. Perhaps currants or raisins with some vanilla instead of lemon would be nice.  I ended up booking for more like 30-35m at 350F with convection mode.

Miso and peanut butter is a really nice combination.  I like how to author was making peanut butter cookies and ran out of pb so replaced with miso then liked them better.  The addition of miso really makes a different.  The recipe is from New York Times site.  I like to cut down on the sugars a bit since doesn't need so much sweetness.  Perhaps you can double and freeze the uncooked balls.  Chilling in fridge for a few hours makes the dough much easier to shape into balls.

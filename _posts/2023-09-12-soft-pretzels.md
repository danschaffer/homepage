I really like making soft pretzels for the textures and salty bready tastes.  The Samantha video pretzel recipe gets a dark
pretzel by adding brown sugar to the dough and water when boiling.  Also interested to see if baking the baking soda before
adding to water bath makes it more like a lye bath. Hoping to also make a cheese sauce for dipping. Making pretzel bites is 
good for a crowd otherwise I like making a few large pretzels.

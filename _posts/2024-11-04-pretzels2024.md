Pretzels are one of my favorite things to make.  I like this recipe for dipping the pretzels in baking soda (made stronger by baking) cold water bath instead of boiling water.  To make the baking soda more caustic bake for 1h at 300F.  Be careful with baking soda since it can be an irritant and damage stuff if you spill it.

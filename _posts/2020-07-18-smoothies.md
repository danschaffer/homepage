Interested in trying out some smoothies.  I started reading the Smoothies Project cookbook.  Seems like mostly get the ratio correct
and mix about 1 1/4 cups of frozen fruit with 3/4 cup of some kind of milk and 1/2 cup of yogurt.  Then for taste you can add protein powder
and some kinds of spices.

For a really blue smoothie can use Blue Magik (made by E3 Live) or spirulena powder.  I am interested in trying tumeric powder, cinnamon,
spinach and kale in smoothies.  Seems like also almost any fruit or vegetable frozen can be added to smoothies.  Could be a good way to use leftovers.

We have a pretty good Breville blender.  It's no VitaMix but does well for smoothies.  The blender has a setting for smoothies adjusting
the speed and breaking up the frozen pieces in the beginning.  I just put all the ingredients together but make sure there is enough liquid
with solid for a smooth blending.  Using weight is easier than measuring but the numbers are very flexible and you can adjust based on how thick
you like the smoothie and what you have available.

### Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cups (150-180g) frozen fruit (berries, banana) can include 1/4 cup of frozen cauliflower for texture
- 1/2 cup (120g) plain yogurt
- 3/4 cup (180g) milk (can be regular, coconut, almond, oat)
- 1 serving protein powder (optional)
- honey, cardamom, lemon peel and pith

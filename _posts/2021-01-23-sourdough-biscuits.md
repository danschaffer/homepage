Trying out this recipes for buttermilk biscuits.  The recipe looks like a good way to use the sourdough discard.  Milk can be substituted for the buttermilk.  The sourdough discard should add some flavor and extra lift to the biscuits.  I like serving with some butter and jam.  For an extra shine
you can brush the tops with cream or melted butter.

### Ingredients
- 230g all purpose flour
- 1t baking powder
- 1/2t baking soda
- 1/2t salt
- 130g butter (a little more than 1 stick 9-10T) but into 1/2 inch cubes
- 200g unfed sourdough starter
- 120g buttermilk

### Steps
- preheat oven to 450F
- whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt
- cut in butter,  can mix with hands squeezing the flour into the butter until butter looks like coarse pebbles
- mix in sourdough to flour mixture
- form a well and pour in buttermilk
- mix until combined into dough
- can lightly flour surface and press dough into about 1 inch thick
- cut with biscuit cutters and place on a cookie sheet
- bake for 13-15 minutes until the tops becomes golden brown

I always wondered how to make mochi since it seems very difficult.  Turns out
the secret is getting mochi flour. I found some at an asian market but can buy
Mochika on amazon for reasonable price.  The trick is dealing with the
stickiness. The coconut flavor in the mochi is nice.  I used a canned coconut
oil and a single batch uses about half a can.  The mochi can be flavored with
fruit powder or cocoa powder.  Also can add food coloring to change color.  I
prefer just plain and white color.

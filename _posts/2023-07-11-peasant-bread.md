I like the idea of a simple bread without the fussiness of shaping dough.  Baking the dough is a glass pyrex gets a nice shape avoiding density problems.  I replace some of the water and flour with sourdough.  I found the round loafs come out a bit weird since the outside does not crisp.  I changed to loaf pans instead.  I am hoping the recipe is easy and flexible enough to use instead of buying store bought bread.  I will try some other variations but so far making this recipe once or twice a week is 
enough to keep the bread supply going.  I like the suggestion of bread crumbs when gets a few days old.

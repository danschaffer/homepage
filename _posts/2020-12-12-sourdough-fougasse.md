Found a new sourdough bread recipe on food52.  The recipe is on http://theperfectloaf.com along with some other really nice sourdough
recipes I have been trying.  The fougasse is a like a crispy focacci and makes a nice bread to tear off pieces and eat with hummus or
other snacks.  You can add herbs but I just used olive oil and Maldon salt.  By starting the in the morning it can be baked at dinner time.
Most of the time is just letting the dough rest and rise. I halved the recipe just to make one fougasse.  I used all King Arthur ap flour but
you can add replace about 100g of the flour with whole wheat.

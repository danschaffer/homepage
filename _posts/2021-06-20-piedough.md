I prefer a pie crust of about half vegetable shortening and half butter for the fat.  The shortening adds a flakiness I do not get from
the all butter doughs.  They say all butter tastes better but I think the half and half has great flavor without worrying about overworking
and risking losing flakiness.  I try to do half and half but if I am
short butter or short on shortening I just replace equal amount of fat
by weight.  This recipe is modified from Erin McDowell's Book of Pie
all buttah pie dough recipe.  I like how she explains the cubing of butter.  I always make the dough the evening prior to baking and allow
the dough to chill in the fridge in discs wrapped in plastic wrap.  

Makes a dough crust smallish size.  For deep apple pie and adjust the ratio with 420g flour.  I use this size for glass dish fruit pies such as the strawberry rhubarb and blueberry nectarine or any custard
type pies.

#### Ingredients
* 300g (2 1/2c) ap flour
* 2g (1/2t) kosher salt
* 1T granulated sugar (omit if not a sweet filling)
* 113g 8T (1 stick) unsalted flour
* 113g vegetable shortening
* 60-70g ice cold water

#### Steps
* measure flour into large bowl
* add salt and sugar to flour
* keep butter and shortening very cold
* cube the butter into about 1/2 inch cubes (like to use brench scraper)
* cut shortening into similar small size pieces
* add butter and shortening to flour and squeeze butter pieces into flour with fingers until ressembles coarse pebbles or sand

* add water
* mix with hands until forms a ball, can add 1T at a time extra water until comes together
* cut into two equal size pieces one can be slightly larger (larger can be top crust)
* get pieces of plastic wrap on small plate and press ball into a disc
* place 2 wrapped pieces of dough on plate in fridge and let cool for a few hours (can be 1-2 days, I usually do overnight)
* roll out each piece carefully flouring rolling pin and surface
* make sure fits pie plate and place bottom crust in pie plate
* add filling, then roll out top crust
* can sprinkle sugar on top and can brush egg wash on top to make golden crust

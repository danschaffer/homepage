I like the really quick and easy cake recipe.  You can just toss the ingredients in a cuisinart, blender, or mixer.  Then just put in a baking dish and bake.  It takes longer to preheat the oven than to prepare the batter.  The recipe fits well in a small cake pan we have 6 inches across.  For a regular size cake pan probably doubling works better.  I have used regular milk, butter milk, or cream.  They all work ok but the cream is a richer cake.  The cake is great in summer when you have some whipped cream and fresh fruit for toppings.  I like to add some lemon zest and juice to the batter to give a little more citrus flavor.  The recipe is my from sister's friend website [Lisi's Luscious Desserts](https://lldesserts.com/yellow-cake/).

### Ingredients
- 3/4c + 2T sugar, 6.125 ounces, I prefer less sweet 5-6 ounces

- 1/3 cup heavy cream (or buttermilk or regular milk)

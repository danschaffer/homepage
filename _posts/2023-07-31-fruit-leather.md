The first part of the video shows an easy recipe for fruit leather.  Our new air fryer has a dehydrate mode but seems easier to
use an oven where you can use a full size cookie sheet with silicon mat.  You can use the lowest setting of oven or 175.  Seems 
like convection mode would dry the fruit faster.  Making fruit leather is a good use for slightly overripe stone fruit.  You can
also separate the flavors by making separate batches in the blender and pouring into the pan.

We make potato latkes every year for Hannukah.  I use a Cooks Illustrated recipe using russet or yukon gold potatos.  A food
processor makes shredding the potatoes easy.  Peeling the potatos is kind of a pain but goes quickly with a good vegetable peeler.
A key is to get as much liquid out of the potatoes and saving the starch from the potato liquid and adding back as a binder.  An egg
with the starch hold together the potatoes.  I like eating with both sour cream and apple sauce.  The potato pancakes freeze well
and can be reheated in an oven or an air fryer.  2 pounds of potatoes makes about 12 latkes.  I would probably double the recipe
and freeze half of the latkes.  To get more liquid out of the latkes can wrap the potatoes in a clean dish towel and twist.  Getting
water our makes the latkes come together better.  Also while frying batches keeping latkes in a 250 degree oven keeps them warm
and crispy.

- 2 pounds russet or yukon gold, peeled

- add onions, pulse until all pieces are about 1/8 inch
- mix with the coarse potatoes and squeeze as much water out as possible
- can wrap in a towel and twist to get extra water out
- pour off the liquid saving the starch
- mix an egg into the starch
- mix the egg/starch into the potatoes and add salt, pepper
- heat oil in a 12 inch pan
- press about 1/4 cup of the mixture into a disc, add to oil

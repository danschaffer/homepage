I always wanted to make Baked Alaska.  For Mieka's birthday I thought it would be a good opportunity.  We bought really nice ice cream from Honeycomb Creamery along with their homeade cone chips for toppings.  The flavors were cold brew coffee chip and salted caramel crackle. The cake is just a vanilla pound cake.  The process is really just slicing the poundcake and pressing into a bowl then freezing.  Then each ice cream, more cake can be pressed into the bowl to form layers.  You can refreeze between layers.Finally when ready the meringue can be whipped and spread before serving.  Using a creme brulee torch you can brown the outside.  The cake turned out to be not too difficult to make.  Also the cake lasted well by storing the freezer.  


#### Ingredients
* 1 pound cake see [pound cake recipe](https://www.danschaffer.info/pound-cake/)
* 2 pints of really good ice cream
* 6 egg whites
* 1/4c granulated sugar
* 1/2t cream of tartar powder

#### Steps
* bake a pound cake recipe, vanilla or can make a different flavor
* when pound cake is cooled slice into about 1/2 inch slices
* find a small bowl to be the baked alaska size
* line the bowl with parchment paper to allow removing the bowl
* press slices of pound cake into the bowl in a single layer
* let freeze about 2 hours
* soften a pint of ice cream and press into the bowl, then freeze for at least another hour
* press more pound cake into the bowl forming another layer
* soften the 2nd point of ice cream and press into the bowl
* can refreeze bowl with ice cream
* finally add layer of sliced poundcake for bottom
* refreeze again

* in a mixing bowl whip the egg whites until they form peaks
* add the cream of tartar and the sugar
* whip further until form stiff peaks and holds when turning spatula upsides down
* remove the bowl from the cake and place on a serving plate or a platter
* spread the meringue over the cake evenly
* with a creme brulee torch, brown the meringue
* can add toppings such as the cone chips for nice appearance
* allow to soften, slice with a sharp knife,  can warm the knife with hot water to make slicing easier
* can store cake in freezer and will be good for several days,  the meringue loses a bit of its consistency in the freezer but overall lasts for a while in the freezer

Squash souffle is a family favorite for Thanksgiving.  I always have had trouble getting the souffle to be fluffy.  One
key is getting as much water out of the frozen squash as possible.  I tried defrosting overnight then squeezing with a
towel.  Also having a souffle pan is important to allow nice rising during baking.  Can top with cinnanmon and nutmeg.  Can bake ahead
and reheat later.  I use an 8 inch souffle disk to help the souffle rise and stay fluffly.  I find the souffle deflates pretty quickly.  

### Ingredients
- 1 package frozen pureed squash
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 cups milk
- salt
- 1/2 cup flour
- 4T butter (1/2 stick)
- cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkle on top

### Steps
- mix all ingredients in a bowl until combined
- pour into souffle pan
- bake at 375 for 50-60m until the middle is firm

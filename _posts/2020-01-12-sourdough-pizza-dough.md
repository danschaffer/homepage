I keep a sourdough starter in the fridge and feed it every 1 or 2 weeks.  I often make pretzels, bread but pizza dough is a good use.  I add yeast but the sourdough adds a nice flavor to the dough.

The pizza dough can be made by adding most of the ingredients into a stand mixer with the
dough hook and letting it mix for 5-10 minutes.  The pizza dough is just flour, water, salt, and yeast.  Adding the sourdough gives the crust more flavor.  Having a pizza stone
makes the crust cook easier.  A pizza peel makes sliding the dough on the stone easier. I find the trickiest part adding the topping and keeping the dough from sticking by adding lots of flour and corn meal allowing the dough to slide off the peel.  To avoid
the sticking and sliding you can always just use a cookie sheet and put in the oven
with transferring.

I like dividing the dough into several pizzas.  Dividing into 2 is good but I find 4
works well and you can cook two at the same time.  For this particular time I made four pizzas.  The basic was tomato sauce with cheese.  For the second I did tomato sauce, cheese, and proscuito.  The third was pineapple, gouda cheese, basil, with spicy salsa, then added argula after the pizza was finished.  The last was squash with goat cheese
and tomato sauce.

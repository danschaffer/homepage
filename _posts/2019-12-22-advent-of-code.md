During December I have doing the 2019 Advent of Code just for a programming challenge [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/2019).  Each day a puzzle is unlocked with two levels of challenge. The
puzzles started out fairly easy and some are fairly difficult. I have
coded the solutions in python3 and put the code on my [github](https://github.com/danschaffer/aoc/tree/master/2019) page. So far
I been unable to do 2 of the challenges but hopefully can come up with
solutions when I have more two. The founder of Advent Of Code did an interesting talk on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS9882S0ZHs).  I find attempting the puzzles is a good challeng and although sometimes frustrating it's a fun project to work on to keep
my programming skills sharp.

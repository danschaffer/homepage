Hard boiled eggs are easy to make but come out differently depending on the time and temperature.  Using a sous vide wand seems excessive but they come out exactly the same each time.  I like 170F as a temperature but can be adjusted.  I cook for 30 minutes but anything between 20m and an hour would not make a different.  The temperature can be adjusted to change the consistency.  Dunking in an ice bath can help to solidify the egg.

#### Ingredients
- any number of eggs, I usually do 6 large eggs

#### Steps
### sous vide
- in large pot place sous vide in pot
- add enough water above where water goes out
- preheat to desired temp, 170F
- add eggs
- set timer to 30m
- add eggs to ice bath for a few minutes
- for more cooked yokes do 185F

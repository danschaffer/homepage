I liked the idea of cooking each slice of banana bread in a little butter to make a french toast like slice. The outside gets crispy and the middle gets soft and custardy.  Its a great way to revitalized when a bit stale or just instensify the flavor. Not sure if roasting the bananas in butter adds much since its a bit more work.  Also adding the malted powder is nice but probably not necessary.  Same with the rum.  The whipped cream with sour cream and malted powder takes really nice.  I used a mixer to whip the cream.

Chocolate souffle is easier than looks.  Although is rich and chocolatey the souffle is also light and smooth.  The souffle should be served as quickly as possible after baking to avoid deflating.
I found the inflation was really high when out of the oven but deflated
somewhat when became cool enough to eat.  The souffle was still above the top
of the ramekin and looked nice.  The creme anglaise can be spooned into the
center of the souffle after breaking open the top with a spoon.  We just
served with softened vanilla ice cream instead.  Was a nice treat but will not
be a common dessert.

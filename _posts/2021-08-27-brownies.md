The brownies were popular and I found a fairly easy recipe.  Can try
experimenting with adding other flavors like mint extract.  I liked the 
texture of the chopped chunks along with the cocoa flavor.  The brownies
are good for several days and keep their chewiness.  Tastes really nice
with some vanilla ice cream.

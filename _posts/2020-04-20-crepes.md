Crepes are a fun recipe to make and they turn out really tasty.  You can use a variety of fillings so something appeals to everyone.
We like sauted mushroom and cheese for savory and for sweet any fruit like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries or bananas are nice.

The crepe pancakes are not too hard but take a little practice.  Usually the first crepe is hard to get right.  You have to carefully adjust
the heat to get right.  I sometimes make a drop of batter in center to see if texture is ok after 20s to check if heat of
the pan is correct.  I usually pick up the pan when pouring batter swirl around the pan and fill in if not covered.  After
flipping and cooking the other side can put on wire rack and stack since the crepes do not stick.  

We have a metal Issi whipper to making whipped cream or recently have been making coconut cream whip cream.  In both cases can add confectioners sugar.  With sweet we like nutella and bananas with whipped cream.  Also fruit like strawberries and sugar and nice.  Plain crepes with butter a little brown sugar and a bit of lemon juice is nice.  Can sprinkle more confectioners sugar on top or add whipped cream.  For savor toppings just melting a little cheese
is nice.  We like to saute mushrooms with a little garlic and olive oil until the liquid boils away.  We usually prepare a
variety of fillings and cut each crepe in half so we can try a few halves each.  I prefer to add the filling and fold in
half.  We all enjoy crepes and you can make lots of different types with fillings so everyone has some they like.

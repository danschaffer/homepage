For Pi Day (3/14) I am making this peanut butter banana cream pie from the Book of Pie recipe.  The pie crust is blind baked rather
than parbaked. The crust is fully cooked empty so the only difference between the partial baking is after removing the pie weights
the crust is cooked for another 10-12 minutes leaving it fully cooked.  The custard filling has peanut butter and is cooked on the stove
top then poured into the crust and chilled in the fridge until set.  I made a peanut brittle for topping and also made a peanut
butter whipped cream.  So for assembly after the custard has set before serving you can place the bananas.  The whipped cream can
be piped or poured on the pie then the peanut brittle pieces can be added.  I think the peanut brittle extras will be nice on
some ice cream.  The pie is not too difficult but there are several components.  I made the pie crust the night before then in the
morning formed the crust did the blind baking.  While the crust was baking I made the brittle and custard.  Right before serving I sliced
the bananas and made the peanut whipped cream.  So lots of parts but it all came out well.

Found recipe to make simple potsticker wrappers from Mei Mei.  The wrapper fillings are simple with the ingredients of just flour, water, and salt.  The key is to get a consistency not too sticky.  Can add additional flour and sprinkle more flour while making to keep the wrappers not sticky.  We prefer a simple filling of Impossible plant based meat like a burger.  Ground pork is also really tasty. To keep the filling simple I just mix with ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Feel free to add anything else.  I usually get 30 dumpling.  I cook enough to fill a sauce pan leaving a little room in between.  The rest about half I freeze the rest and use them for another meal.  In the freezer they should last several weeks or longer.  To cook the frozen dumplings can just saute and steam a little extra and they will cook no problem. I like to get a nice sear before steaming.  After the water evaporates they can crisp up a bit.  I like a dipping sauce of soy sauce, sesame oil a bit of rice vinegar. After seeing how easy it is to make dumping wrapper from scratch prefer to make over buying wrappers from the store.

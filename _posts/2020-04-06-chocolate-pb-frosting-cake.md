The chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting is our new favorite birthday cake.  It is a simple two layer chocolate cake from Hershey recipe
with really delicious peanut butter frosting.  We could not get heavy cream due to pandemic conditions and instead used canned coconut cream.  The
coconut cream although thicker worked really well and added a slightly different flavor.  The cake is fairly easy to make and tastes so good.  We
made the frosting while the cake was baking.  It's a great use for our cake stand.

I do not like the name digestive but I like a simple biscuit with whole wheat flour.  The Bon Appetit recipe adds wheat germ but can use oat or ground flax or additional flour instead.  I like the idea of making a few cookies with chocolate and leaving the rest plain.  The cookie will last several days or maybe a week in a sealed container.

#### Ingredients
- 1/2c (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/2c (33g) wheat germ, rolled oats, or ground flax
- 6T (75g) sugar
- 1t baking powder
- 1t salt
- 1 1/3c (167g) whole wheat flour
- 1/4c (65g) milk
- 2oz chopped chocolate
- 1t coconut oil


#### Steps
- preheat oven to 350F convection or 375F normal
- process flour, wheat germ, sugar, baking powder, salt, butter in food processor until butter disappears and have fine floury meal
- add milk, pulsing until damp crumbly dough
- turn onto clean counter press into a ball
- flatten to disk until 1/4in thick
- use 2 1/2 round pastry cutter
- prick with fork
- bake 15-18m
- let cool to crisp up
- melt chocolate and oil in microwave or simmer over water
- using offset spatula spread about 1t of chocolate

The rhubarb and strawberry in the pie is a really nice combination in the spring when strawberries and good
and rhubarb becomes available.  You can adjust the rhubarb amount depending on how much you can get but I prefer
half rhubarb or maybe 1/3 rhubarb if is hard to find or expensive.  The rhubarb adds a tart flavor so you can adjust how much
sugar you prefer.  The tapioca helps to thicken the juices so does not get too juicy.  The next day the filling
thickens and the juices seep into the bottom crust adding nice flavor.  The lemon adds nice tartness and helps bring
out of flavor for both strawberry and rhubarb.  You can use a lemon instead of orange.  I use the same pie crust
as the apple pie.  The pie crust takes some feel to get the right moisture.  If you leave too try becomes difficult
to roll out and too wet the dough is not as flaky.  Brushing an egg on top of the dough before baking adds some crispness and color to the pie crust.
The pie is great with vanilla ice cream or just plain.  I like for breakfast the next day.  Is nice cold from fridge. Stays
good for a few days if you last that long.

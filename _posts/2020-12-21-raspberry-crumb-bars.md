I really like the raspberry crumb bars at the Flour bakery.  The recipe is not too difficult in the first Flour cookbook.  It is nice to make the dough
a few days ahead and baking the bars and doing the topping is fairly easy.  The bars are realy tasty 

### Ingredients
- 2 pounds russet or yukon gold, peeled
- 1 medium onion roughly chopped
- 1 large egg
- 1 1/2t salt
- pepper
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying

### Steps
- make sure the potatoes are peeled
- use a food processor with a shredding blade to shred the potatoes
- remove half and let drain in a sieve, saving the liquid
- replace the food processor blade with the standard steel blade
- add onions, pulse until all pieces are about 1/8 inch
- mix with the coarse potatoes and squeeze as much water out as possible
- can wrap in a towel and twist to get extra water out
- pour off the liquid saving the starch
- mix an egg into the starch
- mix the egg/starch into the potatoes and add salt, pepper
- heat oil in a 12 inch pan
- press about 1/4 cup of the mixture into a disc, add to oil
- cook about 5 at a time
- fry about 3 minutes until the bottom is turning brown
- flip each pancake and cook for about 3 more minutes
- place on cookie sheet and serve right away

Investigating different air fryer wings sauces gochuchang sauce works really well.  We have some gochuchang sauce in a tube.  I tried using ketchup but I think there was too much happening.  Worked well with gochuchang, ketchup, soy sauce but maybe too salt.  I think using tomato paste, vinegar, honey is a better substitute than ketchup.  There are so many different ways to make
the sauce but this a good starting point.

#### Ingredients
- 2T gochuchang sauce

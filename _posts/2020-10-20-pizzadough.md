I have been making pizza about every other week using this sourdough recipe.  I usually start the dough in the morning and by dinner
it is ready to bake.  Making small dough balls about 200g each works nicely.  I used to make dough with yeast but with an active
starter the all sourdough recipe tastes much better.  The dough stretches much better with all sourdough.  I put a pizza stone
in the oven and can usually fit bake two pizzas at the same time.  Having a pizza peel is really nice for sliding the pizza to the
stone.  Have to keep the peel floured so the dough does not stick.  It is important to quickly pour the sauce and place the cheese
and get the pizza in the oven before the dough sticks.  I usually make tomato sauce but a bechamel sauce can be nice also.  I usually
make 5 pizzas with 3 cheese and 2 with different toppings.

# prepare pizza
- preheat oven to 450 deg with pizza stone on lower rack
- flour the pizza peel, press down dough then pick up and stretch and spin until the dough is thin and about 10-12 inches
- quickly slide pizzas on pizza stone
- bake about 10m, checking every few minutes for when cheese starts to brown and edges of dough start to darken

When strawberries are plentiful and good in the spring a strawberry shortcake with biscuits is really nice.  Each biscuit is a good portion and even half a biscuit make a nice size.  I read a tip online suggesting baking biscuit close together in a cast iron pan.  The cast iron gives a nice crisp bottom and supposedly close together in the plan helps them rise more.  I found using butter and adding sugar makes a sweeter and richer biscuit nice for a dessert.  Sprinkling some turbana or thicker sugar on top adds a nice sweet crunch.  THe recipe is nice since you can keep the parts unassembled and will last longer.  We have a whipper so the whipped cream lasts for around a week in the cannister.  I adapted the recipe from https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-homemade-strawberry-shortcake/

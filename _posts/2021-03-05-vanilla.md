I have been interested in making homemade vanilla extract after using a bunch in baking recently and seeing
how expensive vanilla costs in stores.  The homemade extract seems higher quality and easy to make.  I bought
some grade A beans on amazon.  We typically have leftover vodka from some holiday get togethers and we never
use up the vodka.  I made a batch several months ago by splitting some old dried out vanilla beans into an almost
empty vanilla container and filling up with vodka.  The extract came out well so now I want to try the method starting
with an empty jar and adding full beans without splitting.  I am hoping the extract comes out dark like the video
and the seeds still usable after a few months.  I found a narrow and tall almost empty jar containing rose water.  Using
cheap vodka probably makes more sense but we combined a grey goose bottle with the Smirnoff some the vodka bottle
is pretty much tainted already. Looking forward to seeing how the recipe comes out in a few months.

### Ingredients
* 1-2 cups of vodka or rum of a mild flavor
* 5-10 whole vanilla beans

### Steps
* find a jar, preferable tall and narrow, best if can fit vanilla bean without bending
* place the vanilla beans in the jar, can put as many as can fit

* fill the jar with the vodka or rum at least as high as the vanilla beans
* store in a cabinet at room temperature, out of the daylight
* leave for at least a month probably best after 6 months
* the vanilla extra will last for years and the beans can be snipped and the seeds squeezed out for use in baking

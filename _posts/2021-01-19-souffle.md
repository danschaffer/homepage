Making a basic souffle is not as difficult as it seems.  They are not as fussy as everyone says and makes a really creamy and meal.  We have
a souffle cookbook but have only made the one basic recipe for cheese souffle.  It works well in a 4 inch tall ramekin but is also nice with
smaller ramekins.  Last time we made the four individual ramekins and added mushrooms and smoke salmon and other indivualized things to get a variety. Both a single large souffle and 4 individual souffles turned out great. The smaller ramekins take less time.  Next time I want to try the chocolate souffle in small ramekins. The cheese souffle makes a nice meal especially with some nice break and a salad for textural contrast.

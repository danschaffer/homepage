After a few attempts I find it really hard to get the scallion pancakes crispy but not oily.  Next time I will focus on how much oil and how long to cook.  The important factors are frying at right temperature, time the cook, and covering pan.  Its the same dough hot water dough as dumplings.  I read all purpose flour in US has higher gluten so can try to replace some AP flour with cake flour to get a softer pancake.  The video has several different
methods to roll up and form the pancake.  The video also suggests when finished cooking to scrunch up the pancake for extra crispiness.

This Claire Safffitz has a great new video on sourdough bread.  Even though I have been making sourdough bread about once a week for a while there are some good tips.  Many of the steps are visual and by feel so nice to have more information on the steps.  Yesterday I bought some nice wheat flours from Elemendorf bakery.  I made a loaf with Red Fife wheat sourdough.  I find the nicer wheat flours absorb more water and make a nice tasting bread when I use 100g in addition to 350g of King Arthur bread flour.  The wheat flour is really nice when making bread, focaccia, or pizza dough.

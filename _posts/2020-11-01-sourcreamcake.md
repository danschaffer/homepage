Like this easy to make vanilla sour cream cake.  The strawberry quick sauce is a really nice addition and is really nice on yogurt
or ice cream.  Makes a lot of cake so I may half the recipe and use
an 8x8 pan instead of 9x13.  Can also make the full recipe and freeze half of the cake. The cake is really good with both sauce
and whipped cream.  I like the taste of brown sugar with whipped cream.  Usually I whip cream with powdered sugar but the brown sugar
does give a slight butterscotch flavor.

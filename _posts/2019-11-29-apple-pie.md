Apple Pie is quick to make but the crust takes a lot of practice to get the consistency right.  You can always start with a wetter dough to make sure it will stick together by adding more water.  I think less wet is flakier but more difficult to form the crust.  You can always patch the dough when putting into dish since when baking it always forms together.  

I like to use cortland apples since they are really good cooked and hold together when baking.  Macintosh apples tend to turn into applesauce which is also nice.  You can use any combination of apples you like.  The cortland apples can be really large making peeling and coring much easier.  I really like making pies after apple picking when the cortlands are huge.

I found freezing the butter for 30m then grating with a box grater works really well making mixing the dough much easier.  Otherwise slicing the butter and pressing into the flour with hands works.  

I find lemon zest and juice adds really nice flavor.  I prefer less sugar and cinnamon to make a tarter filling.  You can always add more sugar and cinnamon on top of the crust.  I only like cinnamon and sugar and omit nutmeg, all spice , etc for the filling.  Adding the egg white on the top crust before adding the sugar and cinnamon make the crust top nice and crispy and gives a nice look to the pie.  I like to allow the pie to cool for a few hours to cool almost completely.  The pie is almost better the next day.

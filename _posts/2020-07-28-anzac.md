Anzac stands for the Australia / New Zealand Army Corps.  During World War I these cookies were created to send to troops.  The cookies are meant to last long and not go stale.  Ingredients do not contain eggs and liquid is mostly water with a few tablespoons or maple sugar.  I also like how there is not any white sugar although does contain brown sugar.  The cookies last long and remain chewy.  The unusual part of the recipe is boiling water and melting the butter in the water. Sometimes we double the recipe since the cookies last long and do not go stale.  The recipe is from Joanne Changs Pastry Love cookbook.  Originally calls for golden raisins but we prefer to omit.

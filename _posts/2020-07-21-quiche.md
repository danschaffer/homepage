We have been making the quiche crust ahead of time and freezing the dough.  To bake the quiche can just pour the filling into the frozen crust and put in oven.  May take a few extra minutes to bake but the quiche come out great and makes the process faster. If making the dough fresh can chill the dough in the fridge.  The crusts will last for up to a month in the freezer.  We usually make 2 crusts and keep one the fridge for a day and freeze the second pie crust.  For fillings vegetables are good like asparagus, brocolli, mushroom, baby spinach.  We air fry most vegetables.  You can roast or saute.  You really want to remove moisture to avoid being soggy.  For cured meats cooked bacon or ham is nice.  We often
buy a precooked bacon or roast earlier in an oven for 20-25m.  I usually beat the eggs in a mixer the the whip until frothy.  The quiche is nice served warm can let cool for 10-15 minutes.  For leftovers will last 1-2 days.

I like the chive and cheddar biscuits recipe since the dough is similar to cinnamon rolls but not as sweet.  The cheddar and chives have the same sweetness from the brioche style dough but the cheese and chives give a nice savory taste.  The rolls are great for breakfast or snacking.  I have used just basic cheddar cheese a high quality cheddar will add nice flavor.  Also the recipe comes out well with normal butter but a higher quality European style butter will also make the rolls flakier. I find Maurizio's videos great for picking up tips on sourdough.

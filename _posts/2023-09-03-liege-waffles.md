Liege waffles are chewier and breadier than normal waffles.  The dough is not as liquidy and can be formed into balls with your hands. I mix in pearl sugar for a crispy and sweet outer shell. I like how they are not too sweet but you can add some extra sugar to the dough for more sweetness. I use sourdough discard to add a little more complexity. If the sourdough is not active I add a little yeast. Allowing the dough to rise overnight in the fridge works well and makes the dough less sticky and easier to handle. I use a normal waffle maker but the pearl sugar makes the waffle maker difficult to clean. I made a blueberry sauce. Also good with strawberries and whipped cream.

I like this easy and flexible recipe from Sohla on fruit crumbles. The ratio for the filling is 10% sugar and 2% starch.  The sugar can be honey or sugar.  Other nice flavors are lemon zest and juice.  Adding vanilla might be good also.  Can also use frozen fruit as long as is fully defrosted.  I prefer to reduce the sugar in the fruit and the brown sugar in the topping.  We were low or oats and substituted some cheerios.

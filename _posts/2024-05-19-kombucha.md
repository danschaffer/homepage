I bought a Kombucha starters kit from the Kombucha Shop.  I was interesting in trying out kombucha as another type of fermentation.  You can customize the kombucha taste and fizziness also trying to lots of different flavorings.  You do need some equipment and special bottles with a tight seal and thin neck.  Kombucha is really just black/green tea, sugar and a scoby (bacteria).  The scoby is a creepy mass of bacteria floating at the top.  Making kombucha is fairly easy.  The first part is brewing tea long for about 10 minutes, stir in sugar, let cool, then add the scoby.  The jar should be covered with a cloth and elastic band allowing air but not exposing.  The first ferment lasts about 8-10 days.  The scoby should eat the sugar and the color should lighten.  After about 7 days you can taste the kombucha each day until is not too sweet and not too vinegary.  When ready the scoby is removed along with 1-2 cups of kombucha.  Place in a jar with cloth over the top held with an elastic band. I have a ph meter and found the scoby and kombucha has a ph of around 1 and tea has a ph of about 5.  Water has a ph of about 7.  The kombucha may start at a ph of 4 and when ready usually goes below 3 (2.7 to 3.5).  The fun part is picking flavoring for bottling.  Fresh fruits pureed or cut into small pieces with sugar works well.  Also bottle all natural fruit juice works.  I tried lemon cut into small strips, ginger cut into small strips, sugar.  Also some tart cherry juice worked well.  The kombucha will get fizzy from processing the sugar when under a tight seal.

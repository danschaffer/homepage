There are lots of ways to make congee.  I prefer to make a really nice homeade chicken broth.  Using a vitamix blender with cooked rice saved lots of make making the congee smooth. 

#### Ingredients
- 1 cup cooked rice, jasmine
- 2 cups homemade chicken broth
- soy sauce
- shredded chicken, hard boiled eggs, sliced scallions optional

#### Steps
- add rice and chicken broth to vitamix blender
- mix for a few minutes until smooth
- in sauce pan add about 1T soy sauce
- heat congee for 10-15m at slow simmer until thickens
- remove heat add chicken, hard boiled egg, scallions

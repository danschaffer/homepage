After roasting a chicken I like to save the carcass freeze.  When I have a few I like to make broth and freeze in cubes. The broth is so good for soup or making rice.  Homeade broth
is so much better than store bought broth.  There are lots of recipe but I just like rough chopping half an onion, chopping a few carrots, and chopping a few stalks of celery. All kinds of fresh herbs are good and you can just add the entire herb stalk.  

### Ingredients
#### 
- 1 or 2 chicken carcasses from roasted chicken or any leftover bones,  if using uncooked chicken wings are good, fill a large pot about 1/3 full
- chop half an onion, several celery stalks, a few carrots
- add parsley, rosemary, thyme, sage, dill whatever you have
- add 2 bay leaves
- add pepper corns
- add water until covering 1-2 inches of water
- bring to simmer
- simmer for 2-4 hours until is golden brown
- let cool, can use some right away or keep in fridge for a few days
- can freeze in ziploc bags or I like to use cube trays

The cranberry orange relish is a quick and tasty alternative to cranberry sauce.  I like the orange flavor and tend to prefer a tarter
version.  You may keep adding sugar until it tastes right.  Just when
it starts slightly sweet I usually stop adding sugar.  I usually make 2 days before thanksgiving to let the flavors combine and mellow.  Also it's nice to get this out of the way.    

2 packages of cranberries does a lot of relish.  You can easily half the recipe.

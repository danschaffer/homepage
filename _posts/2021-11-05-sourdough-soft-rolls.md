Since getting tired of baking sourdough bread these soft pull apart rolls are a nice change once in a while.  The rolls have some milk and butter to make soft and tasty rolls.  I find these rolls easier to make than other rolls.  The egg wash is nice but mostly adds color and a little texture.  I sometimes omit the wash.  The oven with the light on is a good
place to proof the dough especially in the winter when the kitchen is cold.

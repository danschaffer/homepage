I have liked watching Sohla's videos.  This chicken and rice dish sounds nice as you can adjust the spices and vegetables.  The fat rendered from the chicken thighs add lots of flavor to the rice instead of leaving the bits on the pan they get absorbed by the liquid.  I like the idea of mixing the sofrito sauce in a blender.  I may try a hand blender to make the cleaning easier.  Instead of just roasting thighs in the oven and making rice in a rice maker using a one pot method seems to add a lot of flavor. The dry brine seems better to coat for 24 hours but can be done in the morning day of for almost as good an effect.  I used a cast iron put but could use a ceramic dutch oven as well to better store the liquid.  Also some people worry about the acid from the tomatoes reacting to the cast iron.  As long as the cast iron is seasoned should be fine.

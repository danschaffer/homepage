This is my first post.  I decided to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) to build my home page.  The ability to create
a static web page and quickly add content in markdown appeals to me.  I hope to host the page in AWS using s3 and create a ci/cd
pipeline either in AWS codebuild or travis.  For now I am trying to get better at markdown using [this cheatsheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml).  Mostly to start I am hoping to document how I design the home
page and probably secondly describing how I modified the cheap monoprice mini select 3d printer.  I also have lots of kitchen gadgets
and random recipes projects such as sourdough and chocolate chip cookies.  Hopefully I can try to post once a week.  I always have
trouble keeping up on projects especially when writing is involved.  

On the home page my design skills are fairly weak. I have always been more of a backend and command line programmer. I am starting out with the default jekyll minima theme.  For starts I just want to show a sidebar with a few categories to start like home page, 3d printing, and cooking projects.  Once I create a test the page
locally I will manually generate the static site and copy to my s3 hosted site in AWS.

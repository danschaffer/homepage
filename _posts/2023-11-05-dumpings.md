We recently took a dumpings class at Mei Mei teaching folding and cooking techniques. Learning the folding techniques from the demonstration was really great and some basic cooking tips really useful. I prefer the normal pleating but the circular dumpings seem good for soups. We prefer to make a filling with impossible beef just adding some garlic, ginger and soy sauce.
The dumping wrapper brand Grand Marquis found in asian markets work really well. I sometime make my own by using flour, water, salt but getting the right thickness can be difficult.

#### Dough/Wrapper
### Ingredients
- can use Grand Marquis from asian store or make own with a 3" or 4" biscuit cutter
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Steps
- in a bowl mix 2 cup flour and salt
- add boiling water
- combine into a ball
- knead by hand until becomes elastic for 3-5 minutes
- let rest for about an hour
- roll out dough to about 3mm thickness
- using 3-4 inch biscuit cutter make wrappers
- make sure well floured to avoid sticking

#### Filling
### Ingredients
- 12oz impossible meat
- 2 garlic cloves
- about 1 inch of ginger
- 1T soy sauce
- 1t sesame oil

### Steps
- combine meat with garlic,l ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil
- can use right away or keep in fridge

#### Assembly
### Steps
- place spoon full, about a tatter tot size, 1T amount of filling in center of wrapper
- dab water with finger around edge or wrapper all around
- Use folding techique, half moon, pleated, triangle or belly button
- make sure edges are pinched and can use flour so does not stick

#### Cooking
- Can pan sear, steam, or boil
### Steps
- Add 1T neutral oil to non-stick pan over medium heat until oil shimmering not smoking
- Place dumpings in pan so not touching, turn heat down medium/low
- Add about 1/4c water, about 1/2 inch of water, shielding yourself with lid to avoid oil splatter
- Let steam covered with lid for about 5-7m,  if frozen add 1-2 minutes
- when look slightly translucent remove any excess water or let evaporate
- continue cooking a few minutes while bottoms get crisp

#### Dipping Sauce
- The sauce is optional and you can add just about anything.  I like a simple light and dark soy sauce with some chili crisps
### Steps
- In a small bowl add about 1T soy sauce, 1T dark soy sauce, 1t vinegar, chili crisp and mix

#### Storing
- store any uncooked dumpings by freezing in sheet pan for several hours then transferring to ziplocs
- they should last in freezer for 2-3 months

Liked this sourdough pancakes recipe.  I found the pancakes fluffy and had good flavor with not too
much of a sourdough taste.  Also nice to not have to prepare a batter the previous night.  I just used
active starter and mixed in the morning.  A cast iron pan with some melted butter gave a nice brown color and nice texture.
The more butter the more fried taste the pancakes take on.  After pouring the pancakes in the hot cast iron
I added chocolate chips and ripe banana chunks to a few of the pancakes.  The pancakes come out best if
you cook one side fully and flip only once.  Also I had some strawberry syrup and some maple syrup on hand
and both were very nice additions.

Got the recipe from this website [Taste of Lizzy T]](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/sourdough-pancakes/)

- 1 1/2 cup, milk
- 1 large egg beaten
- 2 T, vegetable oil
- some butter for the pan

### Steps
- whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar in a large bowl
- add sourdough starter, milk, egg, vegetable oil to bowl
- mix with a wooden spoon until combined and no flour streaks
- heat a cast iron pan with some butter until sizzling
- add about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake,  can make 2 or 3 simultaneously
- can add blueberries, chocolate chips, banana chunks to any pancakes optionally
- cook for 1-2 minutes, can peak at bottom to check when starting to have dark spots

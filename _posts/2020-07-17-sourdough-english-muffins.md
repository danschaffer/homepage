I make this sourdough english muffin recipe really often.  The muffins are best on the first day but last two or three days.  The muffins are good toasted especially after first day.  The video describes each step well.  I shorten the recipe by baking after keeping them in the fridge overnight.  I like making them for breakfast so just remove from fridge divide into 8-9 balls. After shaping into balls I cook in a cast iron.  Also I don't cook in cast iron after baking since don't think they need additional crisping.

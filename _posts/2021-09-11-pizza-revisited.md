Have been making pizza almost every week on Sundays. I usually increase the recipe while keeping the same ratio. Using a 
bakers percentage where flour is 100% I use water 63%, starter 15%, salt 3%,
olive oil 2%.  For 6 small pizzas about 8-10 inches each I use 750g flour, 472g
water, 112g starter, 20g salt, and 15g olive oil.  As working with the dough I
keep adding flour to keep it workable.  
The pizza seems to taste best when making the dough on a Friday or Saturday then keeping in the fridge for a day or two.  
Best to take the dough out of fridge to get to room temperature for about an hour. 
I usually make a tomatoe sauce and grate mozarella cheese.  For other toppings
I like to saute mushrooms to get the moisture out.  Also caramelizing onions is
nice.

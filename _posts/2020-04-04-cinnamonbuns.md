Really like this cinnamon buns recipe from the Americas Test Kitchen Bread Illustrated cookbook.  We made these on Christmas morning and have made them since for a nice Sunday breakfast.  I prefer to make the dough the day before and let the buns rise in the fridge.  The morning of you just have to bake and apply the icing.  The day before you must allow the dough 2 1/2 hours so I usually make the dough in the evening and before bed roll out, add topping, and slice.  The icing
adds a lot of sweetness and makes it gooey so could be omitted but I like the whole thing together.

Makes 8 large buns.

I found the recipe from food52 on cooking crispy tofu with a simple brown sauce. So far just tried the firm tofu but would like to try to soft tofu. Seems really convenient to keep tofu in the freezer.  The brown sauce ingredients are not too exotic and not too many ingredients. The dish is nice served over white rice.

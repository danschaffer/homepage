When fresh fruit is available a fruit crisp is an easy way to make a nice dessert.  I like an oatmeal, brown sugar, flour topping.  The combination of nectarine or peaches with blueberry goes well. Adding a bit of lemon zest and juice adds nice flavoring. I prefer plain but nice with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.

#### Ingredients
### fruit filling
- 5-6 peaches or nectarines
- 1 pint blueberries
- 1t lemon zest, about half a lemon
- 2t lemon juice, few squeezes from half lemon

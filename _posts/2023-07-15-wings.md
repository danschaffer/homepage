I watched a video on air fryer wings from Mike on Pro Home Cooks. He tried several methods with the airfryer including baking powder, flour, breading (flour, egg, breadcrumb), parboil, corn starch and twice fried.  In the video the breading and twice
fried were the winners.  I would probably stick with flour for simplicity though.

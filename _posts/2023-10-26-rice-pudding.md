Found this great rice pudding recipe from food52.  I like how the recipe has few ingredients and does not need any milk or cream and makes rice milk from brown rice and water.  It really helps to have a vitamix blender for grinding the rice.  The recipe is super easy.  I found it a bit sweet so I may reduce the sugar and add honey or maple syrup as a topping.  The rice pudding was great as is but adding some other textures like nuts or dried fruit would be great.

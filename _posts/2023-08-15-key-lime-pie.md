Key lime pie is a great pie to make anytime of year.  In the winter when no fruits are in season its good choice for pie.  The sweetened condensed milk provides most of the sweetness of the filling.  I like how the cream cheese makes the topping thicker and more stable.  I think a mixer works well for the topping but whipping by hand lets you get an exact thickness.  I love the 
tanginess and lightness of the pie.

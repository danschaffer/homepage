I have been making chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich from an Americas Test Kitchen recipe.  The cookies recipe is modified from the normal
recipe adding flavor, making flatter, and staying soft when frozne.  Adding water seems to make the cookies flatter.   Using extra vanilla makes cookies still tasty when frozen. All brown sugar and no white helps chewiness and freezes better.  I have used light brown sugar and the recipe still works.  The mini chips are
easier to eat frozen so no teeth are injured.  The cookies last for a week or two in the freezer although have never lasted more than a few days.  The recipe makes
about 10-12 sandwiches.  I like vanilla ice cream but most flavors will be good.

### Ingredients
- 10T unsalted butter, 1 stick plus 2T
- 3/4c, 5 1/4 oz dark brown sugar
- 3/4t salt
- 1c + 2T 5 2/3 oz all purpose flour
- 1/4 t baking soda
- 2T water, I usually add a little extra, more like 3T
- 2t vanilla
- 12c (3 oz), semi sweet mini chips
- ice cream, less than a pint, depends how much you prefer on each

### Steps
- preheat oven to 350 F
- brown butter, put all butter in a pan and heat over medium stirring, until the bubbling stops and you can see brown in the melted butter
- whisk sugar and salt in medium bowl
- pour melted butter into sugar and salt mixture, mixing until combined
- in separate medium bowl whisk flour and baking soda
- add egg, water, vanilla to brown butter and sugar mixture, whisk until combined
- stir in flour and mix until combined and no flour streaks appear
- add chips,  can save come for outside
- portion cookies with 1T scoop allowing lots of room for cookies to spread flat
- bake 9-12m, rotating halfway, remove from oven when edges starting to turn brown
- let cool for 5m and 45 minutes on a rack fully cooled
- let ice cream soften slightly
- pair cookies with similar sized cookies
- make about 3-4 sandwiches by spreading a small scoop in center then press top slightly to spread ice cream
- if wish, can put more mini chips around edges of ice cream
- keep in freezer for 3 hours to fully freeze before eating

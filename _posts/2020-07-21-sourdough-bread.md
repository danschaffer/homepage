I really like this youtube video from Food52 with Sarah Owens on a great sourdough bread recipe.  The video goes into a lot of details on how to prepare and shape the dough.  Since the recipe is just
sourdough starter, water, flour, salt the details on technique for mixing and shaping is really important.  Mostly I try not to deflate the dough.  I have been watching the video many times and make the bread once or twice a week.  I found using a proofing basket made a big difference in shaping the dough.  Without a basket I baking in a loaf pan since the dough become really flat without the proofing basket.  The proofing basket same with a lame for slicing the top.  I am not great and the fancy designs but usually do a single slice on the top.  I found the dutch oven works well for developing a good crust.  The taste of the bread with the starter is really great and I will probably not go back to using yeast in breads.

I like a basic waffle recipe.  Using sourdough discard adds nice texture.  I think adding some brown sugar gives a little sweetness.  The recipe is better when the batter is left to sit overnight but they still come out well if the batter is made right away. I like waffle with fruit and maple syrup.  Can add some yogurt or some whipped cream.

#### Ingredients
### overnight batter
- 1c 240g sourdough starter "unfed"
- 1c 224g buttermilk (can use milk)
- 1c 120g flour
- 1T 13g light brown sugar
### batter
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 c melted butter or oil
- 1/2t vanilla extract
- 1/2t salt
- 1t baking soda

#### Steps
### night before
- the night before mix starter, buttermilk, flour, sugar
- stir until combined

- whisk the egg, butter, vanilla in a small bowl
- add the sponge from the night before
- heat waffle iron
- ladle batter and let cook for a few minutes then flip
- can store cooked waffles on cookie sheet in 180 deg oven to keep warm
- can freeze extra waffles

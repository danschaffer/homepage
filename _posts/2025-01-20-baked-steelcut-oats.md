The baked oats recipe is a great versatile recipe for breakfast or a hearty snack.  I made once with apples and again with blueberries.  Worked well either preparing the night before or just making the day of.  Since it takes an hour to bake it won't be ready for a while but I enjoy baking on weekend morning.  I like how to oats come up tasty but not too sweet. You can bake in ramekins separately instead of a single pyrex but I find the pyrex easier.  I maybe like apple better but blueberries and good and other fruits can be used also. The leftovers are great for several days microwaved with a little milk or cream. I may trying different spices and you can adapt in many different ways to make sweeter or more savory.

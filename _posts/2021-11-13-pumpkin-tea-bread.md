I have tried a few pumpkin tea bread recipes but like the recipe from the Tartine cookbook.  Usualy I lower the sugar a bit.  I used to make banana bread often but we need all our
bananas for making smoothies these days.  The recipe has nice fall spice flavors.  For mixing the ingredients I prefer to use two bowls and whisk by hand rather than use the mixer.  When adding the dry into the wet I switch to a spatula. 

#### Ingredients
- 230g flour
- 1.5t baking powder
- .5t baking soda
- 1T + 2t ground cinnamon
- 2t ground nutmeg
- 1/4t ground cloves
- 1c (255g) canned pumpkin puree
- 1c (240ml) canola oil (weights about 180g)
- 1 1/3 cups sugar (265g) I lower to about 220g
- 3/4t salt
- 3 large eggs

#### Steps
- preheat oven to 325F
- in bowl whisk dry ingedients, flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves
- in larger bowl whisk pumpkin, oil, sugar, salt
- when uniform add whisk in eggs one at a time until combined
- with spatula mix in flour to wet in a few batches
- mix until uniform, try not to overmix just go until combined
- butter a 9x5 loaf pan
- smooth top and can sprinkle some sugar on top
- bake for about 1h until cake taster comes out clean

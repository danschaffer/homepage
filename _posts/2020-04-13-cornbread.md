Found this online but really liked the proportions.  Was nice and moist and not too sweet.  We made
the cornbread with chili.  The cornbread was nice mixed with the chili as well as separately.  We
even had the cornbread with a little butter the next morning for breakfast.  I think the buttermilk
adds better flavor and little tang.  Recipe works fine with regular milk.  We use whatever cornmeal
we have available.  I prefer a finer ground to make bread smoother but coarse makes grainier and still tastes
good.  I think the honey adds nice sweetness without using white sugar.  I usually bake in a bread loaf pan
but you could also make in muffin tin just watch the looking time since probably finishes earlier.  If you
wish can make spicy by adding some jalapenos or pickled jalapeno peppers.

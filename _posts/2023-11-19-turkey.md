I got some good info from the youtube video but I like to roast upside down (dark meat up) then flip the turkey. With a 10-12 pound turkey flipping is easy just by taking a few paper towels.
To get the skin crispy and help tenderize the meat I do like to pull the skin off and put some salt and sugar under the skin. Ordering a turkey and picking up on Tuesday allows about 2 days
of putting in the fridge uncovered and making sure the turkey is ready.

This stir fry with ricecake noodles appeals to me. Seems like should be a quick recipe
and can adjust based on what your have around. I will skip the cabbage and use brocolli and 
spinach I have them around. The ricecake noodles are frozen from hmart and shrimp is usually
frozen.  By soaking both they defrost and retain moisture for the stir fry.  I don't have a 
wok but use a large saute pan.

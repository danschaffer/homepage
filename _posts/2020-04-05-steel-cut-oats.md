There are some overnight steel cut oat recipes but seems like slow
cookers on low should be 4-6 hours so overnight is too long.  This
recipe allow you to put oats in boiling water off heat and leave
overnight.  The next morning you just reheat for about 5-10 minutes.
I like brown sugar and milk with some dried fruit and nuts for toppings.
Some kind of fruit compote or apple sauce is also good.  We had some old strawberries
and sauted with some sugar and ginger.  It made a nice topping along with some
pecans.

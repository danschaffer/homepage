I liked watching Sohla's video on food 52 for making vanilla pound cakes.  I started by making just the vanilla and hope to try swirling chocolate and perhaps trying a a fruit cake with blueberries and jam.  In the video usually I do not beat the butter long enough in a mixer and following the tips I hope the improve the consistency of the cake.  Also I like the tips to swirl the batter before baking.  I found the cake really nice although for the 
plain vanilla I liked having a stawberry sauce or making a lemon glaze.  I was not really a good crack at the top for the expansion but I'll try again next time.  From the video I like the options to add things. Another good tip is to really get everything to room temperature.  Usually the eggs and butter are cold from the fridge when cook them.  This is a good recipe and start with and I like all the options.

I have been reading the Sourdough book by Sarah Owens.  She describes creating a sourdough by creating a mother with water, sugar, honey, and raisins for about a week before adding with flour and water to create the sourdough.  I feel like my other sourdough has been a little sluggish probably because it is cooler and drier in the kitchen for winter.  I want to see if the new starter is more aggressive than the old one.  The other starter was made just from mixing equal parts water and flour for several days. I am hoping the new starter doubles after feeding and floats in water.

### Ingredients
- 685g water
- 150g granulated sugar
- 65g raw honey
- 225g raisins
- 175g bread flour

### Steps
- in saucepan combine 570g water and the sugar, heat on low until sugar dissolves
- when water cools stir in honey
- add to jar
- keep on warm place like on the fridge
- shake a few times a day for
- after 3-4 days should start smelling like alcohol and the lid should pop a bit releasing carbon dioxide when opening
- leave lid slightly ajar or loose
- after 6-7 days when bubbles start to form get clean jar
- mix 60g of yeast water with 60g of flour
- stir and leave lid ajar 
- after about 8 hours or overnight add 115g water, 115g flour
- about once a day discard about 100g, add 50g water and 50g flour to replenish
- the starter should float when dropped in water
- the starter should about double after refreshed
- the start is ready to make bread

### Progress
- after mixing the ingredients on the first day

- after shaking on the sourdough on the second day, raisin are puffing up taking up lots of space, color is darker

I found this recipe from Americas Test Kitchen.  Using unflavored potato flakes to save a lot of time avoiding baking potato and getting the right consistency.  The recipe really takes so much time off the recipe and I don't really notice the use of instant potatoes.  We usually eat all of the gnocchi but you can always freeze by putting the cookie sheet in the freezer then when frozen moving to a freezer safe plastic bag.  I like draining the gnocchi then adding to a tomato sauce.  You can also just
saute with butter and herbs plus a pinch of salt.

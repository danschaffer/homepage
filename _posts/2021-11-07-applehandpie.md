I first made the hand pie recipe from the Sarah Owens Sourdough cookbook but then just preferred the standard pie dough I usually make.  Also for flavoring I like just sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice and zest, and a pinch of salt.  I use a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter but slightly bigger like 3 inches may be better.  The crust is really the star since only a few pieces
of apple fit in the pastry.  I really like eating the extra pie filling plain.

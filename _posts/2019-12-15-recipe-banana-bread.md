My favorite banana bread recipe is from the Joanne Chang first Flour
cookbook.  I use less sugar and just add a pinch of cinnamon.  I use about 3-4 very ripe bananas.  In the freezer I keep old bananas then
microwave pour off water and stir until bananas are mixed and almost a paste.  Be careful to whisk or sift the flour well to avoid bad tasting
pieces of baking soda.  I really like the Flour recipes.  They always come out well and the ingredients have weights for using a digital scale.  I usually omit the nuts since some family members do not like them but toasted walnuts add a nice flavor.  You can add them to one side to have some pieces with nuts.

The banana bread lasts a few days if covered.  Usually the banana bread
gets eaten within a day because it is so good.  I like eating the next
day or two after toasting and spreading peanut butter over a slice.

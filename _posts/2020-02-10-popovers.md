For my birthday I got a nice popover pan.  The pan is much deeper than a muffin pan a seems thicker and more sturdy.  Popovers are fairly simple just
consisting of eggs, milk, butter, sugar, flour and salt.  I have a recipe
from the Bread Illustrated cookbook from Cooks Illustrated.  The popovers never came out correctly with a muffin tin or other attempts so I am excited to finally have the proper equipment.  Although yes is specialized popovers are really good I can squeeze them into my muffin pan and mini muffin pan collection.  The recipes bakes at high heat of 450 for 20m than bakes 35-40m at 300.  You poke holes in each popover to let heat escape then bake for another 10m then poke another hole.  The holes should allow the steam to escape and allow the popovers to keep their shape.  I wanted to bake at night and serve the next morning so I can make on a weeknight.  I really like a popover with a good jam but I really like the popover breakfast sandwiches at Clover with eggs and vegetables.  Excited to try both.

Udon noodles are one of my favorite noodles.  I usually buy frozen in asian stores but they are actually not too difficult to make from scratch with just flour, water, and salt.  The dough is 50% hydration and 2% salt so you can use 500g flour, 250g, water and 10g salt.  I think because of the low hydration the salt is added to the water instead of the flour.  Traditionally the dough kneaded with feet instead of hands since it is a low hydration and the kneading would be difficult with hands. You can adjust thickness when cutting but it does expand a little when cooking.

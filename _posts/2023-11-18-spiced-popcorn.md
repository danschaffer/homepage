You can definitely adjust the amount of kernels. The measurements are just approximate and spices best added by feel. You can season and taste based on your liking. I find the olive oil good
for getting the spices to stick otherwise they end up at the bottom. Also when eating you can rub the popcorn on the bottom to get more spices. The red aleppo pepper and nutrional yeast give
the popcorn a dorito like flavor. You can improvise and use all kinds of spices. We got a vinegar salt which makes interesting popcorn.

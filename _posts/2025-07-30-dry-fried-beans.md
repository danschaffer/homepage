I like the stove top recipe for beans since seems a bit easier.  I will try air frying as well but stir
frying allows for cooking of the pork.  the fat from the pork is probably enough to cook the beans.  The
first time I used oil and put the beans and pork but came out a bit oily but maybe they are more dried if you first cook the pork and use the fat to cook the beans.  Under high heat they get nicely charred.

Interesting in making falafel in my air fryer using dried chickpeas.  I think starting from scratch can build the flavor exactly to my preferences.  Using
the air fryer uses almost no oil.  Ideally I would like to make flatbread and hummus to make an entire meal out of it.  The air fryer can cook the falafel
much easier although there is a limit to the number to bake at a time.

I got the idea from Mike Home Cook youtube video.  I would like to try all of the air fryer recipes in the video but will start with the falafel recipe

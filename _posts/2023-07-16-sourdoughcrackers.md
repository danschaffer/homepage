Found another recipe for sourdough discard crackers from [https://alexandracooks.com](https://alexandracooks.com/2022/09/11/easy-sourdough-discard-crackers-5-ingredients/).  I have been saving sourdough discard
in a container in the fridge.  When there is about 200g of discard making these cracker is a nice usage. Maybe once per week making crackers would be a good way to use the discard.  Rolling out thin makes a nice crispy cracker. Also making sure they are not undercooked helps add crispiness.    I like to divide
the dough into two balls and roll out on floured parchment paper.  I keep one batch simple with salt and the other can have herbs or everything bagel seasoning (from Trader Joes).

#### Ingredients
- 200g sourdough discard
- 4T room temperature butter
- 65g all purpose flour
- 65g whole wheat or rye flour
- olive oil for brushing
- toppings, can be sea salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, everything bagel seasoning

### Steps
- combine ingredients in bowl
- mix with wooden spoon until forms a ball
- roll out on floured counter with hands until uniform consistency
- place in bowl and cover, leave in fridge for at least 30m
- preheat oven to 350F
- divide into 2 balls
- roll out each ball of dough on floured parchment paper
- roll out thin to a cracker like thickness,  they may expand a little when baked
- brush with olive oil
- sprinkle toppings: salt, sesame seeds, or everything bagel seasoning
- score with pizza wheel or knife
- bake for 20m until crisp, getting dark, can rotate pans half way through to help even browning

Store bought hummus is pretty good and not sure if making homeade will be worth the effort.  Like anything else you can adjust the spices and make it how you like when making from scratch.  I wanted to use dried chick peas, soaking them with some baking soda overnight softens them.  I retained some of the soaking water
to add later.

### Ingredients
- 227g, 8oz dried chickpeas
- 1t baking soda
- 175g 3/4c tahini
- 6T lemon juice
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1t cumin
- kosher salt
- black pepper to taste
- reserve a few TB of cooking liquid

### Steps
- soak dried chickpeas with 1/2t baking soda overnight, drain and rinse
- drain and rinse
- boil 6c water, simmer chickpeas for 30m
- uncover pot, add 1t salt, cook 10-15m under chickpeas are very soft and smush when pressed between fingers
- skim off skins of chickpeas
- save about a cup of cooking liquid
- blend 1-2m in food processor
- add 3/4c tahini, lemon juice, garlic, 1t salt
- add a few T of cooking liquid,  add a few ice cubes

Looks like a great chicken pot pie recipe in a skillet using a sheet of frozen puff pastry and not the full crust.  Looks easy to make on a weeknight as a one pot recipe.  After roasting a full chicken I like the idea of making a pot pie.  Also a good recipe for leftover turkey after Thanksgiving.  The recipe is from the Half Baked Harvest Super Simple cookbook by Tieghan Gerard.

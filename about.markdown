Hi, I'm a site reliabilty engineer in the Boston area.  I enjoy automating processes and creating
infrastructure.

My other interests are 3d printing, electronics, rock climbing, biking and running!

My home page is meant to document my random notes and projects.

You can find the source code for my site here:
